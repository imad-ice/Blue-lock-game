## Goal Shoot Mechanics

- **When You Shoot:**  
  Isagi can only shoot when positioned in the goal area (tiles 2-5).
- **How It Works:**  
  The game checks if the goalkeeper (Gagamaru) is in a blocking position relative to Isagi.  
  For instance, if Isagi is in tile 1 and Gagamaru is in the adjacent blocking spot, the shot is blocked. Similar checks apply for other goal tiles.
- **Outcome:**  
  - **Blocked Shot:** A "Game Over" message is displayed.
  - **Successful Shot:** A goal sound is played and you win the round.

## Defender Movement

- **Defenders:**  
  **Bachira** and **Nagi** actively chase Isagi.
- **Movement Pattern:**  
  - After each move by Isagi, each defender has a 50% chance to move closer.
  - They calculate the distance (both rows and columns) to Isagi and move one step in that direction.
  - If both defenders try to move into the same tile, one adjusts its path to avoid overlapping.
- **Collision:**  
  If a defender lands on the same tile as Isagi, a catch sound plays and the game ends.
